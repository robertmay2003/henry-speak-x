    <p1>"Henry Speak" is an online application that will translate your every word into something that Henry, friend of the website's creators, <a id="textLink" href="https://github.com/robertmay2003">Physch</a> and <a id="textLink" href="https://github.com/biggomega">biggomega</a> would say. Henry is a man who acts on his own will, constantly referencing whatever he pleases, which makes him all the more entertaining to speak to. We hope that using "Henry Speak" will help your peers see you in a better light whenever you speak to them.</p1>

<h1>biggomega</h1>
<div id="minAbout">
    <p1>biggomega doesn't like to talk much. He prefers a life of solitude, saying as few words as possible and avoiding most human interactions. He has a typing speed of 806wpm, and couldn't beat most people in a fight. With experience in six different languages, he really has a bit too much time on his hands. If you ask him, commies are bad. biggomega is also a pioneer in tie dye art, although many critics claim that he has never even made a tie die t-shirt and is a poser. He disagrees. If there's one thing you should know about biggomega, it's that he's the proud creator of the Minecraft fruit mod; A mod that brought fruits into your minecraft world. Install his <a id="textLink" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hey-beter/ejpilpdcahcfkhanpikmgadenjhpchem">Chrome extension</a> to spruce up your browser.</p1>
